-   [`bootstrap/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22bootstrap%2F%22%5D "bootstrap/"): Contains the scripts that Laravel uses to start and configure the framework.
-   [`config/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22config%2F%22%5D "config/"): Contains all of your application's configuration files.
-   [`database/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22database%2F%22%5D "database/"): Contains your database migration and seeds.
-   [`public/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22public%2F%22%5D "public/"): Contains the front controller and your assets (images, stylesheets, scripts).
-   [`resources/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22resources%2F%22%5D "resources/"): Contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and localization files.
-   [`routes/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22routes%2F%22%5D "routes/"): Contains all of the route definitions for your application.
-   [`storage/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22storage%2F%22%5D "storage/"): Contains compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
-   [`tests/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22tests%2F%22%5D "tests/"): Contains your automated tests.
-   [`vendor/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22vendor%2F%22%5D "vendor/"): Contains your Composer dependencies.

To clone and seed the project, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Edward-Kabue/Todolist-app.git
```

2. Install Composer dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

3. Copy the example environment file and make the required configuration changes in the [`.env`]

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Generate a new application key:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
```

5. Run the database migrations (`Set the database connection in .env before migrating`):

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

6. Seed the database:

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

installing the debug bar

steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Laravel project directory.

2. Run the following command to require the package:

```sh
composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev
```

The `--dev` flag means that this package will only be included in your development environment, not in your production environment.

3. Finally, you can publish the configuration file using the following command:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider"
```

## Installing Laravel Breeze

1. First, navigate to your Laravel project directory in your terminal.

2. Install Laravel Breeze using Composer:

```sh
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
```

3. After the package is installed, use the `breeze:install` Artisan command to install Breeze's views and routes to your application:

```sh
php artisan breeze:install
```

4. Finally, compile your assets:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now, Laravel Breeze is installed and you can start using its authentication scaffolding.

## Installing Blade UI Kit

1. Install Blade UI Kit via Composer:

```sh
composer require blade-ui-kit/blade-ui-kit
```

2. Next, publish the package's configuration file:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BladeUIKit\BladeUIKitServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

3. If you want to customize the views provided by Blade UI Kit, you can publish them to your resources/views directory:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BladeUIKit\BladeUIKitServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

Now, Blade UI Kit is installed and you can use its components in your views.

Remember to replace the `sh` and `php` code blocks with the actual commands in your terminal.
