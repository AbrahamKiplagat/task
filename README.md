To clone and seed the project, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <https://github.com/Edward-Kabue/Todolist-app.git>
```

2. Install Composer dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

3. Copy the example environment file and make the required configuration changes in the [`.env`]

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Generate a new application key:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
```

5. Run the database migrations (`Set the database connection in .env before migrating`):

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

6. Seed the database:

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```
